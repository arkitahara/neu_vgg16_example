Tutorial to use pre-trained VGG16 for defect classification on NEU Surface Defect Database

## Setting up the environment
The environment file `mse_env.yml` is included in this repository. Use this to build a stable virtual environment to run this code. If you need help setting this up, [read the docs](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file).
