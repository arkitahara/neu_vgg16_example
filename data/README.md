# DATA README
This is the data directory. To reduce the overhead of this git repo, the data are not included.

## DATA SOURCE
The data are available from the original source [1], though they might be .bmp files. If you're using the .bmp files, then change the `extension` of files to list from `'*.png'` to `'*.bmp'`.

## DATA FOR CLASS
If you are using this directory as part of a class, please contact your instructor (or designated point of contact) for all datasets that you will explore. 

## STRUCTURING THIS DIRECTORY
For the most basic implementation, download the data you will use to your computer. Then put the directory into the `data` directory. The structure of the directories should be `./data/images/` with all of the images contained within.
